Welcome to **Data Guasu**! In this blog I will be sharing opinions, ideas, experiences and details of projects I have worked on, and my journey to becoming a _data passionist_ (due to the impostor syndrome I'm having trouble calling myself a data scientist). 

As the name implies most posts will be related to data, covering a variety of topics, techniques and technologies as _tools to answering (real life) questions_.

Now, where does _Guasu_ comes from? _I wanted to create some suspense_ .. _drum rolls_ .. Ok, seriously. It comes from Guarani (one of the official languages in Paraguay, in addition to Spanish) and it means **big**. So there it is, the name Data Guasu might refer to big data (I could not find a suitable word of diverse data) but the scope of this blog is much _guasu_ than that.
