### Hello!

On April 2019 I moved to Copenhagen, Denmark where I get to work on fun analytics projects with massive data sets. My interests include exploratory data analysis and machine learning applied to real world problems.

They say that if you can explain something to a child, then you have mastered the subject. That's why I like to write here about things I've learned (or currently learning). I found it's also a good practice to keep track of things that I've done and as a reference for future use.

Since I'm originally from Paraguay you will find some articles in both Spanish and English.

### My Toolkit

- _Web site_: Jekyll, ProseIO with GitHub pages
- _Data environment_: Snowflake as Data Warehouse, Databricks Notebooks for experimenting, PyCharm for libraries and production code
- _ETL/EDA/ML_: Mostly PySpark, pandas on smaller datasets and sometimes R for EDA
- _Data viz_: matplotlib, seaborn, ggplot and Tableau for business reporting
