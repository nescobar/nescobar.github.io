### Hello!

On April 2019 I moved to Copenhagen, Denmark where I get to work on fun analytics projects with massive data sets. My interests include exploratory data analysis and machine learning applied to real world problems. I'm also an avid tennis player so you might find a couple of posts that combine these two passions.

### My Toolkit

- _Web site_: Jekyll, ProseIO with GitHub pages
- _Data environment_: Snowflake as Data Warehouse, Databricks Notebooks for experimenting, PyCharm for libraries and production code
- _Languages_: Mostly PySpark, pandas on smaller datasets and just started to play around with R
- _Data viz_: matplotlib, seaborn for EDA but Tableau for business reporting
